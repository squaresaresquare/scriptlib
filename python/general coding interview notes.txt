step 1
ask clarifying questions
   1. ask about scope, per day or the whole dataset
   2. how should duplicates be handled
   3. scale, does the data fit in memory
   4. how much does performance, vs memory/cpu resource usage, vs maintainability/reusability matter
   5. is the dataset pre-sorted by anything
   
if performance matters use map reduce
   what's the key what's the value
   list vs set (sets use less resources and don't have duplicates)
   
use contains instead of looping (O vs O^2)

If memory is an issue use a generator to create one record at a time.
